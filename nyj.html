    The first chapter delves into the life of Trevor, who was born during the apartheid era in South Africa. The historical context of apartheid is explored, depicting the deeply ingrained racism and segregation that was rampant in South Africa at the time. We learn about the personal challenges faced by Trevor and his family, who were subjected to the burden of the "black tax" - an economic barrier imposed on non-white South Africans.<br><br> 
    
    In the second chapter, we are introduced to Patricia Trevor's mother, a strong and hardworking woman. Despite the challenges of raising a mixed-race child, we witness her unwavering determination and the sacrifices she made. Trevor skillfully employs humor to recount her motherâ€™s experiences. Trevor was born in 1984 to a white father and a black mother, but due to the apartheid laws, his existence was deemed illegal. Through Trevor's use of humor, personal anecdotes, and historical analysis, we gain insight into his unique perspective and experiences.<br><br>
    The chapter discussing discrimination based on skin color is a topic that I can deeply relate to. Growing up in Mombasa County, which is the origin of the Swahili community, I have witnessed firsthand the effects of colorism. Unfortunately, discrimination based on skin color is a common occurrence, and it affects people's lives in various ways. It is disheartening to see how people with darker skin tones are often at a disadvantage when it comes to job opportunities. Colorism remains a significant problem in many societies till date.
